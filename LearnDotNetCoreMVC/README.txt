==> becoming job-ready with .NET Core MVC
 "Software engineer who delivers real, maintainable applications"
> (2–4 weeks) Foundation - your base should be rock solid:
#	C# Fundamentals - You should be able to write and explain:
@		Variables, types, operators, loops, conditionals
@		Classes, structs, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism
@		Collections, generics, LINQ, async/await
@		Exception handling
@		File I/O and delegates/events
*Practice: Write mini console projects (e.g., To-Do app, Student record system).

> (1–2 weeks) .NET Core Basics - Understand what makes .NET Core different from legacy .NET:
#	Cross-platform runtime
#	CLI tools (dotnet new, dotnet run, dotnet publish)
#	Project structure (.csproj, Program.cs, appsettings.json)
#	Dependency Injection (built-in in .NET Core)
#	Middleware & request pipeline
*Note: Understand what happens from request → controller → response.
*Practice: Create a “Hello API” with logging and configuration using dependency injection.

> (4–6 weeks) MVC Deep Dive - go all in:
#	KEY CONCEPTS :-
@		MVC architecture (Model, View, Controller)
@		Routing (conventional + attribute)
@		Controllers & Action methods
@		Razor syntax + Layouts + Partial Views
@		Model binding & validation (DataAnnotations)
@		ViewModels vs Entities
@		Tag Helpers & HTML Helpers
@		TempData, ViewBag, ViewData
@		Filters (Authorization, Exception)
*Practice:
1. Simple CRUD using Razor Views + EF Core
2. Student Management System
3. Blog or Event Management site
*Debug the request lifecycle in Visual Studio.

> (2–3 weeks) Entity Framework Core - Understand ORM properly — this is critical for interviews:
# DbContext, DbSet, Migrations
# Relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M)
# LINQ queries
# Lazy/Eager loading
# Transactions and raw SQL
# Repository & Unit of Work patterns
*Mini-project:
Extend your MVC app to use EF Core with SQL Server or PostgreSQL.
Add search, pagination, and sorting.

> (2 weeks) Authentication, Authorization & Identity 
#	ASP.NET Core Identity
#	Role-based + Claims-based authorization
#	External login (Google, GitHub, etc.)
#	Cookie authentication
#	JWT (for APIs later)
*Project: Add user login/register + roles (Admin, User) to your CRUD project.

> (4–6 weeks) Advanced Topics 
#	Learn & implement:
@		RESTful API with .NET Core Web API
@		Consuming APIs from MVC frontend
@		File uploads/downloads
@		Sending emails
@		Logging & Exception handling (Serilog, NLog)
@		Dependency Injection best practices
@		Configuration management
@		Unit testing with xUnit / MSTest
*Goal: Understand why and how clean architecture works.

> (6–8 weeks) Real-World Engineering Skills - Now you build like a professional.
#	SOLID principles
#	Clean Architecture / Onion Architecture
#	Repository Pattern
#	DTOs & AutoMapper
#	Async programming
#	Docker basics (containerize your app)
#	CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps

*Project:
Build a Production-style project — e.g.,
Event Management System (you already started this).
*Include in Above Project:
1. Authentication + Authorization
2. Admin Dashboard
4. CRUD + search + pagination
5. Logging + error handling
6. Deployment to Azure or Vercel via CI/CD pipeline

> (2–3 weeks) Job-Readiness:  
#	 Portfolio Setup
@		Host 2–3 solid projects on GitHub with:
@		Clean commits
@		Readme with demo, architecture, and screenshots
@		Deployed links

#	 Interview Prep
@		Review common .NET Core MVC interview questions
@		Be ready to explain the request lifecycle and DI concept clearly
@		Prepare short, clear explanations of your projects
@		Practice explaining EF Core relationships & migrations

#	 Extra Credit
@		Learn Blazor (optional but good for future)
@		Explore Microservices (ASP.NET Core Web API + Docker + RabbitMQ)

> Bonus Tip - How to Practice Smart -  Don’t just read or watch tutorials. Do this cycle:
		Learn ==> Build ==> Break ==> Debug ==> Explain

*Note: If you can’t explain how a controller action gets data from a database and renders it in a view without peeking at docs, you’re not job-ready yet.

> My Personalized Path (based on my background)
# 	Since you already worked on your E-LAN Event Management project:
	Rebuild it using ASP.NET Core MVC + EF Core.
	Add login (Identity), admin panel, and CRUD for events, teams, and users.
	Deploy it publicly (use Render or Azure App Service).
	Document everything in your README.
	That single project — if polished — can land you internships or even junior roles.
